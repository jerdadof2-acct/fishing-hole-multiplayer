# fish-behavior-model

Core fish behavior system for simulating realistic fish AI and interactions.

## Fish State Machine
Path: src/fish.js
Importance Score: 85/100

- Fish behavior states: IDLE → HOOKED_FIGHT → LANDING → LANDED 
- Combat duration scales dynamically with fish weight (4-20s)
- Randomized tug mechanics during hooked state
- Progressive fight difficulty based on fish size

## Fish Population System
Path: src/fishTypes.js 
Importance Score: 80/100

- 33 unique fish species across 6 rarity tiers
- Weight-based catch value calculations
- Season-specific availability controls
- Rarity-based experience and monetary rewards
- Location-specific spawn rate modifiers

## Catch Probability Engine
Path: src/fish.js
Importance Score: 90/100

Complex catch chance calculations based on:
- Fish rarity tier multipliers
- Hook timing windows (600-1100ms)
- Equipment modifiers
- Player stat impacts
- Location-specific bonuses

The fish behavior model emphasizes realistic simulation through:
- State-based AI decision making
- Weight-influenced fighting mechanics  
- Multi-factor spawn control
- Complex catch probability calculations

# tournament-system

Tournament mechanics handle player competition and result tracking through several key components:

Primary Tournament Logic (/server.js):

1. Tournament Result Tracking
- Records participation and outcomes of fishing tournaments
- Maintains tournament-specific catch statistics and leaderboards
- Stores historical performance data per player

2. Real-time Competition Features
- Broadcasts tournament catches to participants
- Tracks active tournament roster
- Maintains real-time tournament status

3. Tournament Statistics
- Total weight calculations per tournament
- Fish count tracking
- Biggest catch records
- Tournament participation history

Importance Score: 75/100

Reasoning:
- Core competitive gameplay mechanics
- Essential multiplayer tournament features
- Tournament-specific data tracking systems
- Basic implementation without complex rulesets

The tournament system provides foundational competitive features for the fishing game, though specific implementation details like tournament types, duration rules, or special scoring mechanisms are not defined in the available specification.

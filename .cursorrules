## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The core business logic is organized around water simulation and fishing mechanics, with three primary domains:

## Water Simulation (Importance: 90/100)
`src/water/waterMaterial.js`, `src/water/waterBodyTypes.js`

- Physically-based water rendering with distinct configurations for ponds, rivers, lakes, and oceans
- Dynamic properties system controlling:
  - Wave patterns and flow dynamics
  - Depth-dependent color transitions
  - Light absorption and turbidity
  - Surface reflections based on water body type

## Fishing Equipment Physics (Importance: 80/100)
`src/fishing/rod.js`, `src/fishing/aimRod.js`

- Rod mechanics with spring-based tip animations
- Tension-driven deformation system
- Advanced positioning with 45° tilt mechanics
- Quaternion-based orientation handling
- Idle state micro-sway animations

## Camera Control System (Importance: 70/100)
`src/camera/cameraSpring.js`

- Critically-damped spring following system
- Water-level position constraints
- Target tracking with customized damping

The business logic emphasizes realistic water body simulation integrated with precise fishing equipment control, creating a physically authentic fishing experience through interconnected systems.

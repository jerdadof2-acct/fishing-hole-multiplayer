## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The fishing game business logic consists of four interconnected systems:

## Progressive Gameplay Scaling
Core timing system that adapts game mechanics based on player progression:
- Early game (L1-5): Fast-paced 0.5-2s actions
- Mid game (L6-10): Moderate 2-4s actions 
- Advanced (L11-15): Strategic 3-5.5s actions
- Endgame (16+): Complex 4-7s actions

## Economy Framework
Equipment progression through exponential pricing tiers:
- Multiple gear categories: rods, reels, hooks, lines, baits
- Strategic pricing gates from free to $100,000
- Exponential cost scaling for progression control

## Experience System
Non-linear progression framework:
- Starting requirement: 100 XP (L1→2)
- Mid-game acceleration: 750 XP (L5→6)
- Late-game scaling: 5,000 XP (L10→11)
- Endgame requirement: 20,000+ XP (L15→16)

## Tournament Engine
Competitive gameplay structure:
- 8-player room capacity
- Tournament-specific catch multipliers up to 3x
- Balanced catch probability distribution

Overall System Score: 73/100
Core strengths:
- Integrated progression mechanics
- Multi-tiered economy system
- Tournament-specific enhancements
- Cat-themed fishing elements

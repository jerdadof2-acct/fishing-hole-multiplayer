## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The project implements a multiplayer fishing game with progression-based mechanics and tournament systems.

Core Business Components:

## Fishing Mechanics
- Progressive difficulty system based on player levels
- Four distinct timing tiers affecting gameplay complexity:
  - Entry level (1-5): Quick catches 
  - Intermediate (6-10): Moderate timing
  - Advanced (11-15): Complex timing
  - Expert (16+): Maximum challenge

## Economy Design
- Seven-tier equipment progression model
- Exponential pricing structure from free to premium ($100,000)
- Strategic price points for player progression gates

## Experience System
- Four-tier progression model with exponential scaling
- Custom XP thresholds designed for extended gameplay engagement
- Milestone-based unlocks tied to level progression

## Multiplayer Infrastructure
- 8-player room system optimized for fishing competitions
- Tournament-specific catch multipliers
- Real-time achievement broadcasting
- Live leaderboard system

## AI Competition
- Themed bot system with personality-driven competitors
- Dynamic difficulty scaling based on player progression
- Competitive catch rate balancing

Importance Score: 75/100
This system represents a specialized implementation of fishing game mechanics with unique progression and multiplayer elements, though utilizing standard gaming patterns for core functionality.

## Technical Details

### Experience & Leveling System

**Experience Formula**: `100 * level^1.5`

**Example Values:**
- Level 1: 100 exp cumulative
- Level 2: 283 exp cumulative (183 exp to reach from level 1)
- Level 3: 520 exp cumulative (237 exp to reach from level 2)
- Level 4: 800 exp cumulative (280 exp to reach from level 3)
- Level 5: 1118 exp cumulative (318 exp to reach from level 4)

**Fix Applied**: Corrected `checkLevelUp()` and `levelUp()` to properly calculate experience needed for next level (not current level).

### Achievement System

**Tiered Structure**: Each achievement has multiple tiers (1-8 tiers)
- Tiers unlock progressively as targets are reached
- Rewards scale with tier level
- Progress tracking per tier
- Completion status when all tiers unlocked

**Storage Format**: `{achievementId: tier}` object (migrated from array)

**Evaluation Triggers**:
- On fish catch
- On level up
- On gear purchase
- On gear equip
- On game startup
- When viewing achievements tab

**Cache Management**: Aggressive cache-busting for audio files
**Current Reel Sound**: `src/audio/reel-78063.mp3` (fighting reel sound)
**Volume**: 0.5 (increased from 0.15)
